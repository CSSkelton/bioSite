                    <h1>Church</h1>
                    <p>Marvin has a strong sense of faith, and regularly attends church. He often volunteers his time and skills in order to improve the church grounds, and make sure everything functions smoothly. Also, he goes out of his way to contribute towards any events that go on. </p>

                <p>Being an athlete throughout his educational career, Marvin is still an avid sports fan. Whenever he has the time in his very busy life (usually right after haunt season), he can be found catching up on the games from the season.</p>

                    <h1>Search and Rescue</h1>
                    <p>Marvin also became chief of the local search and rescue team, whose position he is still maintaining. Not only does he coordinate and facilitate training for the team, but he also commands the specialized canine unit the team hosts. With all of these leadership positions he has held, Marvin has become familiar with those involved with making policies for emergency management and strives to improve the field as a whole. Recently, he has helped push policies that will help the search and rescue unit grow, as the community is expected to grow several times over the next decade.</p>

                    <h1>Fire Department</h1>
                    <p>Marvin moved away from home early in order to gain a sense of independence. Upon returning home, he worked in the emergency medicine field for several years. He would hold multiple EMS positions within the community, seeking to provide services to whoever may need it. Marvin would also become the chief of the local fire department, changing their policies to respond to emergencies more efficiently in the area. He is still widely recognized among the local firefighters, and regularly attends their meetings.</p>
