            <p>Marvin isn't your conventional business owner. Even though he caters to thousands of people every fall, some of who come from around the globe to see his show, he tries to never raise the price of admission. His group of volunteers keeps the business thriving, to the point of national recognition.</p>

            <h1>Early Life & Industry Introduction</h1>
            <p>Marvin was raised around skilled labor. Having a constant stream of physical jobs since he was young, Marvin excelled in sports. He and his friends were avid horror fans, and would go out and investigate haunted locations when they had the chance. After moving to Indiana, he would be introduced to the haunted house industry, and absolutely enjoy it.</p>

            <h1>Beginning the Business</h1>
            <p>Marvin started his own haunted house in Indiana. Whenever he moved back down to Kentucky to take care of his parents, he moved the business down with him. His haunted house gained a lot of traction, due to his unique approach of keeping a mostly acting show, when most of his competitors would be moving to animatronics and autonomous shows.</p>

            <h1>Charity and Community Focused</h1>
            <p>Marvin also strives to be selfless in his operations. Every year, all proceeds go to charities. The haunted house would also act as a place where people from the community could get volunteer hours for school or work. Marvin's knowledge in skilled labor has helped many young adults achieve many skills that they could translate into real life, including things like carpentry, plumbing and wiring electricity.</p>
